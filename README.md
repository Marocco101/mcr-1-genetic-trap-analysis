# Unintended Consequences of Antibiotic Stewardship: How Antibiotic Substitution Stabilizes MDR Persistence in French Livestock Ecosystems

## Project Overview
[cite_start]This repository includes the pilot analysis for my PhD research (expected to start in Autumn 2027), focusing on the "Ecoantibio Paradox" in France. [cite: 1, 4]

### The Problem: The Ecoantibio Paradox
[cite_start]Despite a reduction in colistin use in the French bovine sector, phenotypic resistance has increased since 2019. [cite: 4, 19] [cite_start]This suggests that usage reduction alone is insufficient to eliminate colistin-resistant reservoirs. [cite: 20]

### My Hypothesis: The Genetic Trap
[cite_start]I hypothesize an evolutionary "plasmid-to-chromosome transition" driven by the substitution of colistin with Category D antibiotics (trimethoprim-sulfonamides). [cite: 5, 58]
* [cite_start]**Mechanism**: Co-selection with sulfonamide resistance genes ($sul1/dfrA$) physically captures and maintains the $mcr-1$ transposon. [cite: 7, 37]
* [cite_start]**Stabilization**: Insertion Sequence ($ISApl1$) decay locks the resistance gene into the chromosome, neutralizing fitness costs. [cite: 7, 38]

### 2026 Mini-Project Objectives
1. [cite_start]**Structural Analysis**: Identify $mcr-1$ co-localization with $sul/dfr$ genes in public E. coli genomes. [cite: 67]
2. [cite_start]**IS Decay Profiling**: Categorize isolates into Phase 1 (Mobile Traps) or Phase 3 (Stabilized Traps) based on $ISApl1$ status. [cite: 68-72]
3. [cite_start]**Phylodynamic Setup**: Prepare datasets for BEAST 2 spatiotemporal modeling. [cite: 80]

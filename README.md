# Unintended Consequences of Antibiotic Stewardship: How Antibiotic Substitution Stabilizes MDR Persistence in French Livestock Ecosystems

## Project Overview
This repository includes the pilot analysis for my PhD research (expected to start in Autumn 2027), focusing on the "Ecoantibio Paradox" in France. 

### The Problem: The Ecoantibio Paradox
Despite a reduction in colistin use in the French bovine sector, phenotypic resistance has increased since 2019. This suggests that usage reduction alone is insufficient to eliminate colistin-resistant reservoirs. 

### My Hypothesis: The Genetic Trap
I hypothesize an evolutionary "plasmid-to-chromosome transition" driven by the substitution of colistin with Category D antibiotics (trimethoprim-sulfonamides). 
* **Mechanism**: Co-selection with sulfonamide resistance genes ($sul1/dfrA$) physically captures and maintains the $mcr-1$ transposon. 
* **Stabilization**: Insertion Sequence ($ISApl1$) decay locks the resistance gene into the chromosome, neutralizing fitness costs. 

### 2026 Mini-Project Objectives
1. **Structural Analysis**: Identify $mcr-1$ co-localization with $sul/dfr$ genes in public E. coli genomes. 
2. **IS Decay Profiling**: Categorize isolates into Phase 1 (Mobile Traps) or Phase 3 (Stabilized Traps) based on $ISApl1$ status. 
3. **Phylodynamic Setup**: Prepare datasets for BEAST 2 spatiotemporal modeling.
